# [retris-mb](https://github.com/gatlinnewhouse/retris-mb)

R(ust) T(etris) on (m)icro:(b)it v2

&nbsp;

Developed as a final project for Bart Massey's CS510 Introduction to Rust course, I
ported Tetris to the micro:bit v2 with some variations in the tetronimo sizes in
order to fit on the 5x5 pixel grid display. I've been experimenting with an external
display and some song coding so that I could add a full Tetris game implementation
and a thread that plays the Tetris theme song when playing the game.
