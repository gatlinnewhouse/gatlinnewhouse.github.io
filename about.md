I'm a master's student at Portland State University studying Cybersecurity and
systems programming.

&nbsp;

I am interested in: Linux, Reverse Engineering, Kernels, Internet/Radio Protocols,
Bootloaders, Computer Architecture/Organization, or anything that deals with bits.

You can find me on <a rel="me" href="https://defcon.social/@gtn">Mastodon</a>.

I'm also on [ctftime](https://ctftime.org/) as `gtn`.
